            <h2 class="section-title">What is InvisVM?</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM is an ongoing research and development project exploring innovative approaches to window containment and process interaction within the Windows environment. 
                Instead of relying on conventional virtualization or sandboxing, InvisVM takes a unique direction — integrating applications directly into its interface through real-time window hierarchy manipulation.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Functionally, InvisVM behaves like a specialized window manager. When an application is launched through it, InvisVM detects the new window, adjusts its properties, and reassigns it as a child within its own interface. 
                This creates the impression of seamless integration, allowing multiple applications to visually coexist within a unified environment while remaining independent processes beneath the surface.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The project originated as an academic and technical exploration of how Windows applications manage and trust their parent windows — and what insights can be gained by reinterpreting those relationships. 
                Through continued experimentation, InvisVM aims to expand understanding of system-level windowing behavior and its implications for user experience and research.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Core Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM is guided by principles of transparency, experimentation, and accessibility. It is not designed as a product, but as a platform for learning, discovery, and innovation.

                    <p class="feature-text">
                        InvisVM prioritizes exploration and creative problem-solving over production constraints. 
                        Its purpose is to ask "what if?" and to challenge conventional ideas of how applications interact within an operating system.

                    <p class="feature-text">
                        InvisVM serves as an educational reference for understanding real-world Windows programming. 
                        It showcases topics like WinEvent hooks, GDI rendering, and inter-process window management rarely covered in formal coursework.

        <!-- How It Works -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">How InvisVM Works</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM operates by leveraging how Windows handles window hierarchies. Every visual window exists in a parent-child structure that governs behavior, rendering, and event propagation.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM interacts with this hierarchy through a multi-stage process:
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Window Creation Detection</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Using system-wide hooks, InvisVM monitors window creation events in real time. 
                When an application spawns a new window, InvisVM is instantly notified and evaluates it for potential embedding.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Intelligent Window Selection</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM identifies suitable windows using heuristics — filtering out hidden or transient elements like splash screens. 
                It analyzes window attributes such as style, ownership, and visibility to select the correct primary window.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Style Manipulation</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Once selected, InvisVM refines the target window’s appearance by adjusting its style flags — removing unnecessary decorations and preparing it for containment within its own interface.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Hierarchy Reparenting</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                The window is then reparented under InvisVM’s main interface. This creates a visually unified environment while keeping processes logically separate, allowing for safe observation and experimentation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Security Perspective -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Security & Safety Comparison</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM focuses on the study of window hierarchy and process relationships rather than acting as a security product. 
                Its architecture highlights how visual containment and system interaction can coexist within an experimental framework.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Research Perspective</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM’s primary contribution lies in showcasing how applications implicitly trust their parent windows and the potential implications of modifying those relationships. 
                This helps researchers better understand trust boundaries and the subtleties of Windows’ graphical subsystem.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">UI and System Integration</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                By providing a visual containment layer, InvisVM opens doors to new UI paradigms — where process integration, observation, and management can be presented more intuitively.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Future Research Potential</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                The concepts explored by InvisVM can inform the development of real process-isolation systems that combine visual embedding with functional containment, leading to safer and more transparent desktop environments.

        <!-- Limitations -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Current Challenges & Considerations</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM is in active experimental and development stages. While highly functional, certain challenges and inconsistencies remain under ongoing investigation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Application Compatibility</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Some applications use unconventional window management techniques that may behave unpredictably under containment. 
                InvisVM continues to refine compatibility to better handle diverse rendering and lifecycle models.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Windows Version Dependencies</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Due to architectural differences across Windows versions, results can vary. 
                InvisVM adapts dynamically where possible, and compatibility improvements remain a focus of development.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Process Lifecycle Handling</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Because contained windows belong to independent processes, certain shutdown behaviors may differ. 
                Ongoing work aims to improve cleanup handling and reduce residual resource usage after closure.
