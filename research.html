            <p class="content-text">
                Before diving into InvisVM's distinctive approach, it is essential to understand the landscape of 
                virtualization and process isolation technologies. These foundational concepts underpin modern 
                security practices and system management.

            <h2 class="section-title">Traditional Virtual Machines</h2>
            
            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What Are Virtual Machines?</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Traditional virtual machines (VMs) emulate complete computer systems. Platforms like VMware, VirtualBox, 
                and Hyper-V provide virtual CPUs, memory, disk drives, and network interfaces. Each VM runs a full 
                operating system, perceiving exclusive access to hardware while operating entirely within an isolated 
                software environment.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">How Traditional VMs Ensure Security</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Traditional VMs provide robust security through complete isolation. The guest OS cannot access host 
                resources directly, and all interactions pass through the hypervisor, which enforces the security boundary. 
                Malware or misbehaving software remains confined within its VM environment, unable to affect the host or 
                other VMs.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                This isolation requires significant resources: multiple gigabytes of RAM, disk space, and CPU usage. Boot 
                times are measured in minutes. Running multiple VMs concurrently can heavily load the system. Thus, 
                traditional VMs prioritize security and isolation over lightweight performance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Limitations of Traditional Virtualization</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                While versatile, traditional VMs are resource-intensive. They are excellent for testing different operating 
                systems, isolating development environments, or creating secure sandboxes. However, they are not optimized 
                for isolating single applications due to high resource usage and longer startup times. Lightweight tasks, 
                such as opening a suspicious file, do not require a full VM.
            </p>

        <!-- MicroVMs -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">MicroVMs: A Lightweight Alternative</h2>
            
            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What Are MicroVMs?</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                MicroVMs represent a streamlined approach to virtualization. Platforms like Firecracker (developed by 
                Amazon for AWS Lambda), Cloud Hypervisor, and QEMU microvm mode provide minimal virtual machines 
                optimized for speed and efficiency. They include only essential components, start in milliseconds, 
                and consume significantly less memory.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                A microVM contains a minimal kernel, required drivers, and the target application. Removing unnecessary 
                components reduces complexity, improves startup time, and minimizes memory consumption—often using 
                less than 100MB of RAM.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Security Model of MicroVMs</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                MicroVMs retain traditional VM security by providing strong isolation through virtualization while reducing 
                overhead. Each instance runs in a self-contained environment, minimizing the attack surface and maintaining 
                virtual CPU and memory protection.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                They are ideal for serverless computing scenarios, where thousands of isolated instances need rapid startup 
                and efficient execution. However, microVMs are not inherently designed for desktop application integration.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Desktop Considerations</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                MicroVMs excel in headless cloud environments. Desktop applications, which require graphical interfaces, 
                audio, clipboard interaction, and seamless OS integration, present challenges. Bridging these gaps requires 
                additional infrastructure, which reduces the advantages of lightweight virtualization.

        <!-- Containers and Sandboxing -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Containers & Application Sandboxing</h2>
            
            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Container Technology</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Containers, such as Docker, isolate applications by leveraging operating system features rather than virtualizing 
                hardware. Linux uses namespaces and cgroups to separate processes while sharing the same kernel. Each container 
                maintains isolated filesystems, network stacks, and process trees.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Windows supports Windows Containers and AppContainers, primarily for server workloads or UWP apps. These 
                mechanisms provide kernel-level isolation but are not optimized for full-featured desktop applications.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Application Sandboxing Approaches</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                True sandboxing restricts application capabilities through system-level enforcement. Tools like Windows 
                AppLocker, Software Restriction Policies, Chrome’s sandbox, and Windows Defender Application Guard 
                limit access to files, registry, and network resources.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Sandboxes reduce process privileges by assigning restricted tokens, preventing access to protected resources. 
                While this approach maintains security, it requires deep OS integration, which may affect application functionality 
                if the software expects full access.
            </p>

        <!-- InvisVM's Approach -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">InvisVM's Innovative Approach</h2>
            
            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">A Visual-Centric Philosophy</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM represents a distinct paradigm. It is not a traditional VM, microVM, container, or full sandbox. 
                Instead, it leverages window-level manipulation to create a visual containment experience that prioritizes 
                user clarity and interface interaction.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The concept is simple: users perceive visual boundaries intuitively. When an application appears “embedded,” 
                it conveys a sense of containment, serving educational and experimental purposes.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Transparent Containment</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM does not enforce traditional security isolation. Embedded applications have full access to user 
                resources, network, and processes. The containment is visual, designed to demonstrate interface and perception effects.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                By clearly communicating this distinction, InvisVM fosters understanding of the difference between perceived 
                and actual security boundaries, serving as a valuable educational tool.

        <!-- Technical Deep Dive -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Technical Implementation</h2>
            
            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">WinEvent Hook Architecture</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                InvisVM relies on the WinEvent hook system. The SetWinEventHook API monitors system-wide accessibility events, 
                such as window creation. InvisVM uses out-of-context hooks to capture window events without intrusive injection, 
                ensuring stability and compatibility.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Target windows are identified by matching process IDs and validated using multiple criteria including visibility, 
                hierarchy, style, and size. This ensures correct embedding while minimizing interference with other windows.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Window Style Manipulation</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                After identification, window styles are modified using GetWindowLong and SetWindowLong. Visual decorations such 
                as title bars and borders are removed, and windows are reparented as child windows. SetWindowPos updates the 
                visual appearance immediately, creating a seamless embedding experience.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Process Lifecycle Management</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Applications are launched via ShellExecuteEx with monitoring enabled. WaitForInputIdle ensures the target 
                is ready before embedding. InvisVM gracefully manages termination using WM_CLOSE and TerminateProcess as a last 
                resort.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Drawing and Visual Integration</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Rendering uses GDI with double-buffering for flicker-free drawing. Decorative borders highlight embedded windows, 
                and bottom-bar buttons emulate macOS-style controls with interactive visual effects.

                InvisVM highlights implicit trust between applications and their parent windows. While it does not enforce 
                security, it demonstrates how window messages and hierarchies can be observed, providing insights into 
                system behavior.
